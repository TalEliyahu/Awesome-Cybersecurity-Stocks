## Specialists ("Pure Play") vs. Multiservice Cybersecurity

This list categorizes companies into two main types, reflecting how cybersecurity aligns with their overall business model:

- **üéØ Specialists ("Pure Play")**: Focus exclusively on cybersecurity, dedicating their entire business to developing security solutions.

- **üåê Multiservice**: Offer cybersecurity as part of a broader range of technology solutions, such as networking, cloud services, or application delivery.

> **Exclusion**: Tech giants like Microsoft or AWS are not included, as cybersecurity is just one part of their diverse operations.
